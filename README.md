# Advisory-Congestion-Heuristic-LaCAM2

This repository contains code and documentation for integrating advisory congestion heuristics with the LaCAM2 multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) algorithm.

## Overview

LaCAM2 is a state-of-the-art MAPF solver. This project extends LaCAM2 by incorporating advisory congestion heuristics to improve path planning efficiency and reduce agent conflicts in congested environments.

## Features

- Implementation of advisory congestion heuristics for MAPF.
- Integration with the LaCAM2 algorithm.
- Benchmarking and evaluation scripts.
- Example scenarios and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies** (see `requirements.txt`)
3. **Run example scripts** to test the integration

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - Source code for LaCAM2 and heuristic integration
- `benchmarks/` - Example MAPF scenarios
- `scripts/` - Evaluation and utility scripts
- `docs/` - Additional documentation

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions and examples will be provided in the `docs/` folder.
